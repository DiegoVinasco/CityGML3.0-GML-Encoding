|Test ID: |/conf/vegetation/boundaries
|Requirement: |<<req_vegetation_boundaries,/req/vegetation/boundaries>>
|Test purpose: |For each Vegetation space element, verify that if the space element is bounded by thematic surface boundaries using the property _core:boundary_ (type: _core:AbstractSpaceBoundaryPropertyType_), each property contains exactly one surface element from <<vegetation-boundaries-table>> that is supported for the specific space element. If no surface element is supported, the space element is not bounded by thematic surface boundaries.
