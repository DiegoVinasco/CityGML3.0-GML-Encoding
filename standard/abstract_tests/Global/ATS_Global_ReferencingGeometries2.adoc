|Test ID: |/conf/global/referencinggeometries2
|Requirement: |<<req_global_referencinggeometries2,/req/global/referencinggeometries2>>
|Test purpose: a|When referencing geometries of spaces and space boundaries, verify that:

* Geometries stored inline a space boundary are not redundantly stored as geometry of a space. If the geometry is stored with the space in addition, it references the geometry from the space boundary using XLinks.
* Space boundaries do not reference geometries of a space using XLinks.
* This applies for all spaces and space boundaries that are children of the same top-level feature.

|Test method: |Inspect the instance document to verify the above requirement.
